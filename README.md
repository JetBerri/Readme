# What is a README.md?
A README.md file is a Marckdown file that contains all the information and the instructions for the repo. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 

# What instructions should I follow?
It's very simple to install a GitHub repo, you only have to download the repo as a zip file or do a "git clone" to clone the github repo into your system. Then you only have to follow the instructions or at least understand what you are downloading for being able to fix problems with compatibility and download it properly. For example, if you are trying to download a Python project that contains a "requeriments.txt" and a "main.py" file it's obvious that you will have to install the requeriments and just run the main file. In the case that everything is explained, just follow the steps provided and don't open a Issue if you don't know how to use the program, just learn the basics of it and try to find the issue, or Google it!

# What should I do if the program is not working?
It's really simple, you can look for help on the internet or check the code by yourself and try to find the issue, if the issue is big you can contact who created that project and tell him about the problem.
